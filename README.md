- Hi ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m currently a PhD student is Physics.
- Primarily, Iâ€™m interested in Condensed Matter Physics including Physics of Transition Metal Oxides (Mott Insulators, Magnetizm, High-Tc Superconductivity, Quasiparticles).
- My research requires a significant amount of programming including programing in Julia, C++, Wolfram Language (Mathematica), Python, and sometimes other languages mainly to decompose large, sparse Hermitian matrices.
- Recently, I discovered Rust programming language. I like it a lot, can't wait to learn more about it!
