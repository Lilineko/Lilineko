##### About me
- Programming and math enthusiast with a PhD in Physics (Strongly Correlated Systems, Theory).
- I was teaching Complex Analysis, Algebra (I and II) as well as Programming and Numerical Methods at my Uni. I enjoyed it a lot (and so did my students :D).
- I got interested in programming over 10 years ago when attending my first course in this topic (it was taught in PASCAL). I was expanding my skills by writing simple bots to games. I was using Cheat Engine for reverse engineering and Delphi PASCAL for writing windowed apps (for personal/educational use). About year later I switched from PASCAL to C++. 
- I have done a significant amount of numerics (for Bachelor's, Master's and PhD). It was primarily linear algebra and decomposition of large and sparse matrices - often running on HPC (with Slurm). I did 4 internships before Master's where I had to deal with old, crappy, spaghetti codes someone wrote in FORTRAN :D. I improved the performance (sometimes making the code run tens of times faster) or rewrote some of it to C++.
- I'm familiar with a variety of scientific tools (Mathematica, Matlab, Python, R) and have years of experience with data visualization (plots, graphs, 2D and 3D graphics for science and insight communication).
- I'm a coauthor of 5 publications (first author of 4). There are also two more or less finished works I contributed to that may appear in the future.
- I'm most used to C++, Julia and Mathematica. I have some experience with Python, LaTeX, Matlab, FORTRAN, R, Rust, PASCAL (probably not exhaustive list).
