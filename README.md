- Hi ðŸ‘‹
- I studied Nanostructures Engineering (Bachelor, Masters) and recently I obtained a PhD in Physics (Condensed Matter Physics, Theory).
- I'm passioned about mathematics since I was a kid. Also, I like to teach - during PhD studies I was teaching Complex Analysis, Algebra (I and II) as well as Programming and Numerical Methods.
- I got interrested in programming after attending my first course in this topic - it was over 10 years ago. I used to spend my spare time on reverse engineering games and writting simple bots. At the university, I preferred picking courses involving programming. Also, my PhD research required a significant amount of coding (primarily to decompose large and sparse Hermitian matrices). 
- I mainly use Julia / C++ / Mathematica / and sometimes Python. I'm familiar with basics of SLURM queueing system.
