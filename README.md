- Hi ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m a PhD student in Physics.
- Iâ€™m interested in Condensed Matter Physics including physics of Transition Metal Oxides (Mott Insulators, Magnetizm, High-Tc Superconductivity, Quasiparticles).
- My research requires a significant amount of programming in Julia / C++ / Mathematica / Python (mainly to decompose large and sparse Hermitian matrices).
